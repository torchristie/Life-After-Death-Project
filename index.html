        <h1>The Big Question</h1>
        <h2>Is There Life After Death?</h2>

<section class="content">
<h2>Why are we looking into death and beyond?</h2>

<p>It is the question no on truly knows the answer to. There are many different theories about what happens when we die, it is a topic that not many people think about, but it is something that we all have in common. As time has progressed, the overall belief of what happens when we die has changed in society. </p>
<p>As England has become more heterogeneous, there is no one-set belief system in place. Many different religious groups provide their own ideas on what happens when we die, and we will be exploring these later on.</p>

  <h2>How have attitudes to death changed over time?</h2>

  <p>Society is in a constant state of flux, and opinions on death have changed over time. When religion was the focal point of life, there was a level of certainty about what happened after death. Gradually, however, this definity over our posthumous fate has disappeared.</p>
  <p>The timeline below charts how opinions on death have changed over the last few thousand years, and what different historical societies believed regarding death.</p>

<p>With death being discussed as an idea, it is hard to forget it is also a harsh reality. It is very easy, when discussing death, to focus so much on what comes after death that we forget the pain and sorrow that come to those left behind.</p>
<p>Sheffield has faced many periods of extensive death and destruction, and many lives have been lost. </p>
<p>Below are three infographics talking about some of Sheffield’s biggest losses of life, and some figures that go some way towards contextualising the losses that this city has faced.</p>

<h2>Different religious views</h2>

<p>For many people, even in a modern society, what happens after death is predominantly derived from what their religious texts say. Religion is arguably less prevalent in society, however the vivacity with which religious individuals follow their belief has not faded.</p>
<p>We spoke to important members of five major faith groups in Sheffield to discuss where their beliefs sit in the 21st century.</p>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Christian teachings have largely influenced today’s society’s beliefs about life after death. As England used to be a highly Christian society, their beliefs are still prevalent today. They mainly focus on the idea of an afterlife; that everyone will stand before God to face judgement before their soul is passed to either Heaven or Hell. Heaven and Hell are not clearly defined, therefore, different people have different ideas of what these concepts mean.</p>
<p>“None of us truly knows what happens when you die, so I find a little bit of comfort in knowing that I can be peaceful when I leave here. I find it kind of scary to think that nothing would happen when you died, I think heaven is quite a reassuring afterlife. As long as you can say you lived an honest and kind life then I believe heaven is possible for anyone.” – Sunhee Fujikawa, member of the Crystal Peaks Church.</p>

  <img src="images/islam.jpg" alt="Cross" width="100%" class="image">
  <div class="overlay2 overlay">
    <div class="text">
<p>Like Christians, Muslims also believe in facing judgement before Allah when their fate is decided. Those who have lived a sin-free life, or repented for their sins will spend their afterlife in Heaven. Those that have not will face eternity in hell. Heaven is viewed as a joyful place, a place where the human spirit should wish to be. Death is ultimately viewed as a departure from this temporary world, before the soul is moved to the divine realm. </p>
<p> “A Muslim believes that apart from God, everything in this world will finish one day, so there is death for everything and everyone. The death of a loved one is regarded as a departure from the temporary world. In Islam the time of death is predetermined by Allah.” – Imam Mohammed Ismail, Imam at the UoS.</p>

  <img src="images/judaism.jpg" alt="Cross" width="100%" class="image">
  <div class="overlay3 overlay">
    <div class="text">
<p>There are many different ideas about life after death in Judaism. Judaism teaching stresses that the body stays on this earth, but the soul moves on into the next life. Some Jews believe that the soul will face God for judgement and ascend to a place like Heaven (Gan Eden), or it can be passed to a place like Hell (Gehinnom) or await further judgement in Purgatory (Sheol). Other believe in the resurrection of the dead, when the Messiah returns. </p>
<p> “Jews do believe G-d judges us but it effects people differently. Judgement is relative so G-d takes into consideration one’s circumstances and is generally very forgiving. Every year we are judged on Yom Kippur and made to repent for our sins over a period of 10 days – a similar thing is said to happen when we die.” – Sara Stone, President of the Jewish Society </p>

<p>Hindus generally believe in reincarnation, however some believe that before your soul enters a new body it will either go to heaven or hell, and this depends on how you have acted while on earth. Death is a natural process, and is not viewed as a sadness but as the step that follows the one before it. Essentially, it is seen by Hindus as a way of recycling the energy in the body before it enters the next stage of existence.</p>
<p>“Some Hindus do believe in the concept of heaven and hell - svarg and patala respectively. For Hindus heaven and hell is not eternal. The actions you carry out will have a consequence in this life or the next. The decisions we make lead to good karma or bad karma. For Hindus their ancestors are given divine status and believe that good things in their lives are a form of blessings from their ancestors, as well as God.” - GaneshParth Velji, President of NHSF- Hindu Society, Sheffield </p>

    <div class="text">
<p>Buddhists practice the law of impermanence, focusing on the fact that everything in this world is temporary, and therefore it is important to live a full life. Death is not seen as the end of life; it is seen as the last time in that physical body. They believe mainly in incarnation, that the spirit will live on and find a new life and body to attach itself to. Spirits can move on into either one of the six different realms: heaven, hell, animal, hungry ghost, Asura and human being</p>
<p>“We know that we were born, but we cannot know the future: including after death. The term "Live fully, die fully" refers not only to being fully alive in awareness, and embracing the impermanence of all 'states', including when we die.” – Catherine Dee, Sheffield Buddhist Society</p>

  <h1>Graveyards</h1>

  <h2>Why is the ritual of burials so popular in soceity?</h2>

<p>There are over 20 Graveyards in Sheffield, and despite a drop in religious interest in the last few decades, people continue to bury their dead and erect monuments in their memory.</p>
<p>For many, religion and graveyards are not synonymous, and they are a method of remembering loved ones who have passed.</p>
<p>Below, is a detailed map highlighting Sheffield’s main graveyards, and their key features:</p>

<p>Extensive research has been carried out into both the geographical and sociological place that graveyards hold in the modern world.</p>

<p>We spoke to Andy Clayden, senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, who research focuses on cemetery landscapes.</p>

<h5>Why do you feel that graveyards, and respecting the dead, is such an important part of our culture, particularly at a time when religious belief is fairly low?</h5>
      <blockquote class="bq_one">
        Not necessarily a question of religious belief.
        Traditionally we would have recycled the burial space in our churchyards and therefore in many cases graves were not permanent.
        It is only since the 1850s and burial reform that cemeteries provided burial for in-perpetuity that graves have become ‘more’ permanent.
        Also for many religions, the body is immaterial after death <br>
      </blockquote>

<h5>Do you think graveyards will ever give way to a more space and time-effective method of 'dealing' with the dead? If yes, does that point to a lack of continued respect for the dead?</h5>
      <blockquote class="bq_one">
         It already has - cremation. Although slow to become widely accepted in the UK, cremation now accounts for approximately 70% of all disposals.
         You might reflect on how this has changed within your own extended family and if this has any relationship to a perceived lack of respect’.
         I don’t think it does; many of the customer and rituals still continue.
      </blockquote>

<h5>Is the effort we go to with regards to giving our recently departed big ceremonies indicative of a general belief that when we die there is something after that?</h5>
      <blockquote class="bq_one">
        It maybe for some and not for others - I don’t know and probably not related.
        I think it is more likely a reflection of changes in society and growing sense of individual identity and the importance of “celebrity’.
        Perhaps also in the absence for some of a religious framework or understanding of how ritual was traditionally observed it is more a bout the ‘celebration’ of a life.

<h2>Has todays secular society affected these beliefs on death?</h2>

<p>As we have explored, there continues to a wide range of beliefs in what happens when we die. Many religions have staple beliefs that have developed as society’s wider beliefs have. </p>
<p>We asked 40 people three questions to discover whether soceity was in fact largely secular and whether this has affected the beliefs on life after death.</p>

<img src="images/graph1.jpg" alt="graph">

<p>From our survey, we found that a majority of the respondents believed in a strand of the afterlife, or reincarnation. Some respondents who did not identify as religious believed in the concepts of Heaven and Hell whilst other believed that nothing happens once we die. Although some people may not be religious, they tend to find comfort in knowing that they will have peace when they die, or that their energy will be take somewhere else.</p>

<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 400px; width: 100%;"></div>

<p>In our survey, we asked people with different religious beliefs what they believed happens when we die. People from a variety of different religions answered our survey. Half of our respondents were religious, and the other half were non-religious. This reflects the fact that our society is becoming more heterogeneous, that people are able to prescribe to any kind of religious belief they want.</p>

<img src="images/graph2.jpg" alt="graph">

<p>Finally, we asked respondents how these beliefs affected them. A majority of the respondents said that they did not find these beliefs to be incredibly important, or that they affected their everyday decisions. This reflects the declining religious belief in society. However, those who are religious do believe that these ideas are important and influence their day-to-day lives.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>As we have explored, there continues to a wide range of beliefs in what happens when we die. Many religions have staple beliefs that have developed as society’s wider beliefs have. As our survey showed, many people who are not religious believe in an afterlife, possibly due to this country’s past primarily Christian beliefs.</p>

<p>We also found that a majority of people felt that their beliefs in the afterlife were important to them and affected the decisions that they made in their day to day life. Therefore, it is clear to say that beliefs in what happens when we die are still of grave importance to society. These ideas affect our day-to-day decisions and attitudes towards death as a whole. </p>
